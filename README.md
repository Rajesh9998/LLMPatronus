**Your AI-Powered Security Guardian for Android Applications**

LLMPatronous is an innovative framework designed for the static analysis of vulnerabilities within Android application codebases. It leverages the power of multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) through a Mixture of Agents (MoA) architecture and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide comprehensive, accurate, and efficient security assessments.

## The Problem

The rapid growth of the mobile app market, dominated by Android, highlights a critical need for robust application security. Current vulnerability detection methods often fall short:
*   **Static Analysis Tools:** While useful, they often generate a significant number of false positives (sometimes exceeding 40%), wasting valuable developer time.
*   **Manual Code Audits:** Thorough but expensive and time-consuming, failing to keep pace with modern rapid release cycles.
This gap leaves millions of users vulnerable. There's a clear demand for more accurate, automated, and scalable security solutions.

## Our Solution: LLMPatronous

LLMPatronous addresses these challenges by utilizing cutting-edge AI techniques:

*   **Leveraging LLMs:** Harnesses the contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities of various LLMs to analyze code for security flaws.
*   **Mixture of Agents (MoA):** Employs a multi-layered architecture where different specialized LLMs (agents) collaborate to analyze specific vulnerability types, enhancing accuracy and reducing false positives compared to single-model solutions.
*   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Integrates with a knowledge base (Pinecone Vector Database) to provide LLMs with up-to-date, context-specific information about known vulnerabilities and secure coding practices, overcoming LLM knowledge cutoffs and improving analysis quality.
*   **Large Codebase Processing:** Integrates with the Google AI Studio API, enabling the analysis of extensive codebases (even thousands of lines) in a single run, which many traditional tools struggle with.
*   **Comprehensive Reporting:** Utilizes powerful models like OpenAI's o1-preview to generate detailed, professional Vulnerability Assessment Reports based on the findings of the analysis layers.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Highlights

*   **AI-Powered Static Analysis:** Deep code analysis for Android applications using multiple LLMs.
*   **Mixture of Agents (MoA) Architecture:** Developed by Together AI, this approach combines the strengths of diverse LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3-haiku, Qwen-2-72B-Instruct, Meta-Llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct-Turbo, Meta-Llama/Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct-Turbo, Databricks/DBRX-Instruct, Gemini-1.5 Pro) for refined detection accuracy.
*   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Ensures real-time, comprehensive insights using Pinecone vector database.
*   **High Accuracy:** Achieved **81.9% accuracy** on predefined vulnerability lists during testing, significantly reducing false positives.
*   **Scalability:** Handles large codebases efficiently via Google AI Studio API integration.
*   **Professional Reporting:** Generates detailed Vulnerability Assessment Reports using advanced models like OpenAI o1-preview.
*   **Reduced False Positives:** The MoA approach, using diverse LLMs tailored to specific security aspects, minimizes false positives common in single-LLM or traditional static analysis.
